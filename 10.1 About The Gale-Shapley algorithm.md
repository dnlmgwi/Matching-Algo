# About The Gale-Shapley algorithm

The Gale-Shapley algorithm is a method for finding a stable matching between two sets of individuals, where each individual in one set (called the "proposers") expresses a preference list over the individuals in the other set (called the "acceptors"). The algorithm works by iteratively having the proposers make proposals to the acceptors, and then having the acceptors either accept or reject the proposals based on their own preferences.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

Each proposer proposes to their most preferred acceptor.
Each acceptor either:
Accepts the proposal if they are not already engaged to another proposer, or
Rejects the proposal and remains engaged to their current proposer, if any.
If an acceptor rejects a proposal, the proposer moves on to their next most preferred acceptor and repeats the process.
This process continues until all proposers are engaged to an acceptor.
At the end of the process, the resulting matching is stable if there are no pairs of individuals who would both prefer each other over their current partners. This is because if such a pair exists, they would both prefer to be with each other instead of their current partners, which would create instability in the matching.

The Gale-Shapley algorithm is often used to solve the stable marriage problem, which involves finding a stable matching between two sets of individuals (usually men and women) based on their preferences for one another. It is also used in many other matching situations, such as matching medical residents to hospitals or matching students to schools.
