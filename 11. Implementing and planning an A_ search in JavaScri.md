# Implementing and planning an A* search in JavaScript

A* is a search algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph. It combines the benefits of Breadth-First Search and Greedy Best-First Search, using a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal.

Here is an outline of how you might implement A* in JavaScript:

Define the graph that the search will be performed on. This can be represented using an adjacency list or matrix.

Define the start and goal nodes.

Create an open list and a closed list to keep track of the nodes that have been visited.

Add the start node to the open list.

While the open list is not empty:

Find the node with the lowest f-score (total cost) on the open list and move it to the closed list.

For each neighbor of the current node:

If the neighbor is the goal node, stop the search and return the path.

If the neighbor is not in the closed list, add it to the open list and compute its f-score (total cost).

If the search has completed and the goal has not been found, return null to indicate that no path was found.

Here is some pseudocode that demonstrates the basic structure of the A* algorithm:

```JavaScript
function aStar(graph, start, goal) {
  // create an open list and a closed list
  let openList = [start];
  let closedList = [];

  // while the open list is not empty
  while (openList.length > 0) {
    // find the node with the lowest f-score on the open list
    let currentNode = findLowestFScore(openList);
    // move the current node to the closed list
    closedList.push(currentNode);
    // remove the current node from the open list
    openList = openList.filter(node => node !== currentNode);

    // if the current node is the goal, return the path
    if (currentNode === goal) {
      return reconstructPath(start, goal);
    }

    // for each neighbor of the current node
    for (let neighbor of getNeighbors(graph, currentNode)) {
      // if the neighbor is not in the closed list
      if (!closedList.includes(neighbor)) {
        // add the neighbor to the open list and compute its f-score
        openList.push(neighbor);
        computeFScore(neighbor, goal);
      }
    }
  }

  // if the search has completed and the goal was not found, return null
  return null;
}
```

You will need to define the findLowestFScore(), reconstructPath(), getNeighbors(), and computeFScore() functions in order for this pseudocode to work. The findLowestFScore() function should return the node with the lowest f-score on the open list, the reconstructPath() function should return the path from the start to the goal, the getNeighbors() function should return the neighbors of a given node, and the computeFScore() function should compute the f-score (total cost) of a given node.
