# About Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a method for finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. This algorithm works by starting with an initial matching, which is a subset of the edges in the graph such that each vertex is incident to at most one edge in the matching. The algorithm then iteratively increases the size of the matching by finding an augmenting path, which is a path from an unmatched vertex on one side of the bipartition to an unmatched vertex on the other side such that all of the edges in the path are not in the current matching.

To find an augmenting path, the algorithm uses breadth-first search to explore the graph from the unmatched vertices. When it reaches a vertex that is already matched, it continues the search from the other end of the matching edge. If it reaches an unmatched vertex on the other side of the bipartition, it adds the edges in the path to the matching, effectively "augmenting" the matching.

The algorithm continues this process until it cannot find any more augmenting paths. At this point, the matching is said to be maximum, since it cannot be increased further.

Overall, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a simple and effective way to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph, and it has a time complexity of O(Ef), where E is the number of edges in the graph and f is the maximum flow in the graph.
