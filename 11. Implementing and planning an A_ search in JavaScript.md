# Implementing an A* search in JavaScript

A* is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph. It combines the strengths of two other popular algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm, which can be used to find the shortest path between two points, and a breadth-first search, which is guaranteed to find the shortest path but may be slower than other algorithms.

Here is some pseudocode that outlines the steps involved in implementing an A* search in JavaScript:

```javascript
function aStarSearch(startNode, endNode) {
  // Create an open set to hold the nodes that have not been evaluated yet
  let openSet = new Set([startNode]);

  // Create a closed set to hold the nodes that have already been evaluated
  let closedSet = new Set();

  // Set the start node's g value to 0 and its h value to the estimated cost to the end node
  startNode.g = 0;
  startNode.h = estimateCost(startNode, endNode);

  // Set the start node's f value to its g value plus its h value
  startNode.f = startNode.g + startNode.h;

  // While the open set is not empty
  while (openSet.size > 0) {
    // Find the node in the open set with the lowest f value
    let currentNode = findLowestFNode(openSet);

    // If the current node is the end node, return the path
    if (currentNode == endNode) {
      return getPath(endNode);
    }

    // Remove the current node from the open set and add it to the closed set
    openSet.delete(currentNode);
    closedSet.add(currentNode);

    // Get the neighbors of the current node
    let neighbors = grid.getNeighbors(currentNode);

    // For each neighbor of the current node
    for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
      // If the neighbor is already in the closed set, skip it
      if (closedSet.has(neighbor)) {
        continue;
      }

      // Calculate the tentative g value for the neighbor
      let tentativeG = currentNode.g + calculateCost(currentNode, neighbor);

      // If the neighbor is not in the open set, or if the tentative g value is lower than its current g value
      if (!openSet.has(neighbor) || tentativeG < neighbor.g) {
        // Set the neighbor's parent to the current node
        neighbor.parent = currentNode;

        // Set the neighbor's g value to the tentative g value
        neighbor.g = tentativeG;

        // Set the neighbor's h value to the estimated cost to the end node
        neighbor.h = estimateCost(neighbor, endNode);

        // Set the neighbor's f value to its g value plus its h value
        neighbor.f = neighbor.g + neighbor.h;

        // If the neighbor is not in the open set, add it
        if (!openSet.has(neighbor)) {
          openSet.add(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // If we get here, it means that there is no path from the start node to the end node
  return null;
}
```

In this pseudocode, the findLowestFNode() function is used to find the node in the open set with the lowest f value, and the getPath() function is used to trace the path from the end node back to the start node by following the parent references of each node. The calculateCost() function is used to calculate the cost of moving from one node to another, and the estimateCost() function is used to estimate the cost of moving from one node to
