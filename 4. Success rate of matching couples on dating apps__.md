# Success rate of matching couples on dating apps

It's difficult to quantify the success rate of matching couples on dating apps, as it can vary widely depending on a variety of factors. Some of these factors include the **quality of the matching algorithm**, the level of user engagement, and the individual preferences and personalities of the users.

There have been a few studies that have attempted to quantify the success rate of matching couples on dating apps.

One study found that around one third of relationships that start online end up in marriage, which is slightly higher than the success rate for relationships that start offline. Another study found that couples who met online had a slightly lower rate of marital break-up than couples who met offline.

It's important to keep in mind that the success of a relationship is not solely determined by the method by which the couple met. There are many other factors that can contribute to the success or failure of a relationship, such as communication, shared values and goals, and the level of commitment from both partners.
