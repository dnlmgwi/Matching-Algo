# Api Endpoints

There are several endpoints that a matching algorithm API might need to have for a dating app, including:

1. A "/match" endpoint - this would allow users to browse potential matches based on specific criteria, such as age, location, interests, and preferences.
2. A "/swipe" endpoint - this would allow users to indicate their interest (or lack thereof) in another user by swiping left or right.
3. A "/message" endpoint - this would allow users to send messages to one another and start conversations.
4. A "/profile" endpoint - this would allow users to update their profiles with new information, photos, and preferences.
5. A "/notification" endpoint - this would allow users to receive notifications when they have a new match or message, or when someone has liked or swiped on their profile.
6. A "/match history" endpoint - this would allow users to view their past matches and conversations.
7. A "/blocking" endpoint - this would allow users to block other users they do not wish to communicate with.
