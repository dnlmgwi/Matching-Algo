# More about Dijksta's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm that can be used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It has a time complexity of O((V+E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of vertices, with the priority of a vertex being the shortest distance from the source vertex to that vertex. At each step, the algorithm selects the vertex with the smallest distance, and updates the distances of its neighbors using relaxation. The distances of the neighbors are updated if the new path to them is shorter than the current path. This process continues until the distances of all vertices have been determined.

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is largely due to the use of the priority queue, which requires logarithmic time for insertions and deletions. In the worst case, the algorithm may have to visit all vertices and edges, leading to a time complexity of O((V+E) log V). However, in practice, the algorithm often terminates earlier, leading to a lower average time complexity.

It's worth noting that Dijkstra's algorithm is not suitable for graphs with negative edge weights, as it can produce incorrect results in such cases. For negative edge weights, Bellman-Ford algorithm or Johnson's algorithm can be used instead.
